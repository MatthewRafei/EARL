* Building the Project

** Debug Mode

By default, the project is compiled in /"debug"/ mode. This enables the following flags:

#+begin_quote
*default* =-std=c99 -pedantic=

*+* =-ggdb -DDEBUG -Wextra -Wall -Werror -Wswitch-default=
#+end_quote

All assertions and code sections that are inside of
#+begin_src c
  #ifdef DEBUG
  ...
  #endif
#+end_src

will trigger. Issue the following to continue:
#+begin_src bash
  make
#+end_src

** Release Mode

The /"release"/ mode enables the following flags:

#+begin_quote
*default* =-std=c99=, =-pedantic=

*+* =-march=native=, =-O2=, =pipe=

*-* =-ggdb=, =-DDEBUG=, =-Wextra=, =-Wall=, =-Werror=, =-Wswitch-default=
#+end_quote

It also disables any code sections inside of =#ifdef DEBUG=.
Issue the following to enable /"release"/ mode:

#+begin_src bash
  make PROFILE=release
#+end_src

** Tests

To run the tests, issue:

#+begin_src bash
  make test
#+end_src

The tests can also be run with release mode if so desired.

Issue =make clean= to remove all object files.
